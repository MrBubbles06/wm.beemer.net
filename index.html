    <p>i decided to write a bunch of my thoughts down here for some reason- so thats what i'm gonna do. ig.</p>
    <h3>2021 10 12</h3>
    <p>because i know nobody is ever gonna see this probably - i can pretty much say whatever the fuck i want to say and noone will ever see it. which is pretty cool. i'm having pizza for dinner. thats pretty nice. i'm writing this website by hand (without a cool website editor like wix. <a href="https://imgur.com/VrmVBex">see here</a>.) i don't know what i should be writing. i'm also gonna use this site for some expirements that don't work on an online html editor like uhh... idfk code.org's weblab. i'm watching a deadmau5 live stream rn. hes just talking to chat. which is pretty cool. idk how i'm gonna style the rest of the posts. like if i put it in a list like
      <ol>
        <li>1st post</li>
        <li>2nd post</li>
        <li>3rd post</li>
        <li>etc</li>
      </ol>
      or the opposite way with old posts at the bottom and new posts at the top :/ --- doesn't matter honestly i'll probably forget about this tomorrow.<br><br>ALSO if you see this and are like part of my computer science class and don't know anything and want to learn or something (idfk maybe i'm a genius probably not) all the html and css files are on github so you can like - see all the "code" for the website. yea.</p>

      <p>GUESS WHAT! I FORGOT ABOUT THIS! FOR LIKE 2 WEEKS. BUT nevertheless it does not matter any more. I have a lot to say because I'm REAL FUCKING PISSED. I dated someone for like 2 months, we'll call her "jane," anyway, <em>jane</em> broke up with me, in a TERRIBLE way, by texting me in the middle of 1st period and not really explaining why, and she said she still wanted to be friends, but that didn't really work out (ill get into that) but anyway, she broke up with me a week after I introduced her to my friend Evan, which at the time, I was kinda like "oh whatever it was just a coincidance" but I guess it wasn't cause they are dating now. I really couldn't care less about it, which I've told her before, cause I kinda acted like the "jealous ex" for a while, which was really stupid on my part because it's a high school relationship of course it's not gonna work out, but I was teasing her about it during lunch with some of my friends (she wasn't there, which was probably not cool, I was joking about it, I wasn't really being serious, but that doesn't matter cause it was still a dick move,) and then ANOTHER one of my friends, Aidan, was all like "william was telling everyone that YOU were dating EVAN" and then she was all mad at me or whatever "keep your nose out of my private relationships" and stuff. WHICH IS TOTALLY FAIR, I SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT FROM THE BEGINNING, but it's not like I can change the past so theres no point in regreting it. Anyway, I responded, like an idiot, totally brushing it off and placing the blame on someone else (aidan), and she was like "ok well just stay out of my buisniss(or however you spell that)" so I just said sorry, and left it at that. At this point, I'm kinda done with my relationship with her, she's said that she doesn't want to be friends with me anymore, and shes gonna stop talking to me. And I'm totally fine with that. From my perspective, she ghosted me like 2 weeks ago when I said something about Evan and her, so I was kinda done. I sent her an "apology" and I really wanted to be agressive and like "fuck you" but I decided against it, cause she already thinks I'm a "jealous asshole ex," and I didn't want to fuel that. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/kXIV8d9">here is that AND her response</a>. NOW I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT. That was the closure. I apologized, she said we were done done, that was it. But then I learned that she was screenshoting everything I said and sending it to aidan, and they were all talking about it and shit, and from what I read, she really made me seem like a real FUCKING ASSHOLE, and while I value my relationship with aidan alot, it's definantly over. I'm still glad it wasn't with some of my other friends though. But because of that, she has made me so paranoid about my relationship with all of my close friends. I don't know who she's told, I don't know who she is talking to behind my back, because she told me she wasn't gonna tell anyone from the school, and she has told me she wouldn't screenshot things and send them to other people. I can't talk to anyone about this, and the worst thing that I see right now, is that aidan never went to me about any of this. She just trusted "jane" about everything she was told, and never went to me to say like "is this true" or anything. She just acted like a bitch about it and did the same thing "jane" did (screenshot our conversations and send it to "jane"). I hate how paranoid this has made me. I feel doubtful of relationships I've had for multiple years and there isn't anything I can do about it because I can't confront Aidan about it because she just ignores me and flips the subject on its head and somehow makes the conversation or argument about me instead of her and "jane." And I can't talk about it with "jane" because she blocked me and will probably think I'm desprate or something stupid. I feel traped. I also can't talk about it with any of my friends who I think will understand, because I don't know who will screenshot it and tell "jane" or who "jane" has already talked to. And I still don't know why she broke up with me. So I have nothing to go on, and I feel lost. Even friends who I've met in high school (vs been with sense middle/elementary) are in classes with either aidan and "jane" and i.. I'm just lost. I don't know who to go to or how to handle this because I'm not emotionaly mature enough to deal with any of this without either acting jealous or like a todal douche. I really want to just go up to aidan and "jane" and go "fuck both of you" but I can't do that because it's mean and and I don't want to be that person. I also can't go and beg for forgivness cause thats petty and stupid. I don't want to be the person to bitch and moan about an "ex-lover" and thats alot of the reason I can't go to any of my friends. Also one of her big things was that nobody can know about our relationship, but I guess Evan is different cause she told a bunch of people about that today. I'm probably just paranoid, but IT'S BECAUSE OF HER so I'M JUST SO FRUSTRATED. I have every single message we've ever sent eachother saved (for unrelated reasons to the break up, I just keep back-ups of literally everything) so if she starts spewing bullshit, I can still defend myself. It also hurt a lot to see "jane" say "I trust you[aidan] more then <em>him</em>" but never the less, HOPEFULLY it's all in the past and everyone can just forget about it.<br>this was a long one. ig:<br><br>TL;DR: My ex made me feel paranoid about a lot of my close relationships with long time friends, and I'm scared, confused, frustated, angry, and a lot of other things, but I can't talk about any of it because of the paranoia thing.</p>
