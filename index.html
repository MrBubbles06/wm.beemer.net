    <p>i decided to write a bunch of my thoughts down here for some reason- so thats what i'm gonna do. ig.</p>
    <h3>2021 10 12</h3>
    <p>because i know nobody is ever gonna see this probably - i can pretty much say whatever the fuck i want to say and noone will ever see it. which is pretty cool. i'm having pizza for dinner. thats pretty nice. i'm writing this website by hand (without a cool website editor like wix. <a href="https://imgur.com/VrmVBex">see here</a>.) i don't know what i should be writing. i'm also gonna use this site for some expirements that don't work on an online html editor like uhh... idfk code.org's weblab. i'm watching a deadmau5 live stream rn. hes just talking to chat. which is pretty cool. idk how i'm gonna style the rest of the posts. like if i put it in a list like
      <ol>
        <li>1st post</li>
        <li>2nd post</li>
        <li>3rd post</li>
        <li>etc</li>
      </ol>
      or the opposite way with old posts at the bottom and new posts at the top :/ --- doesn't matter honestly i'll probably forget about this tomorrow.<br><br>ALSO if you see this and are like part of my computer science class and don't know anything and want to learn or something (idfk maybe i'm a genius probably not) all the html and css files are on github so you can like - see all the "code" for the website. yea.</p>
